#Build process
Clone or download the repo
If you don't have Angular CLI installed: 

    npm install -g angular-cli@latest

    ng init

Input n for each file to not overwrite any file changes

    ng serve
    ng serve --prod 

Will kick off a production build with uglifying and tree-shaking.

This will kick off the server at http://localhost:4200/. Any changes you do to the source files should automatically reload the app.
